# AggregateListFunction class

This allows to create a function for an [`IAggregateListAction`](./IAggregateListAction.md). It can have different behaviors. It can use an [`IMicroflowExpression`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Model.MicroflowExpressions/IMicroflowExpression.md) to generate its result, or it can use an [`IAttribute`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Model.DomainModels/IAttribute.md) to do so. Or it can instead be an aggregate list that performs a [`ReduceListFunction`](./AggregateListFunction/ReduceListFunction.md) on the list. All of these parameters are optional. For more information see the official Studio Pro documentation at https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/aggregate-list. To create this function for different scenarios, you can use the [`IMicroflowActivitiesService`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Services/IMicroflowActivitiesService.md) service. It provides a series of methods to easily create different activities.

```csharp
public class AggregateListFunction : IAggregateListFunction
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [AggregateListFunction](AggregateListFunction/AggregateListFunction.md)() | It is recommended to use the [`CreateAggregateListActivity`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Services/IMicroflowActivitiesService/CreateAggregateListActivity.md) method to easily create an activity that uses this function. |
| [AggregateListFunction](AggregateListFunction/AggregateListFunction.md)(…) | It is recommended to use the [`CreateAggregateListByExpressionActivity`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Services/IMicroflowActivitiesService/CreateAggregateListByExpressionActivity.md) method to easily create an activity that uses this function. (3 constructors) |
| [Attribute](AggregateListFunction/Attribute.md) { get; } | The [`IAttribute`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Model.DomainModels/IAttribute.md) used to perform the aggregate operation. If provided, the [`Expression`](./AggregateListFunction/Expression.md) should not be provided as well. |
| [Expression](AggregateListFunction/Expression.md) { get; } | The [`IMicroflowExpression`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Model.MicroflowExpressions/IMicroflowExpression.md) used to perform the aggregate operation. If provided, the [`Attribute`](./AggregateListFunction/Attribute.md) should not be provided as well. |
| [ReduceListFunction](AggregateListFunction/ReduceListFunction.md) { get; } | The [`ReduceListFunction`](./AggregateListFunction/ReduceListFunction.md) used to only perform a reduce operation on the list. It is recommended using the [`CreateReduceAggregateActivity`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Services/IMicroflowActivitiesService/CreateReduceAggregateActivity.md) to have an easy way to create that type of activity. |
